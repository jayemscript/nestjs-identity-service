# Authentication and Identity Service

Status: proposed first-release architecture; application shell and Session 2 persistence baseline implemented locally. Last reviewed: 2026-10-27.

This documentation defines how to turn the NestJS scaffold into a reusable HTTP authentication and identity service. It is intended for the engineer or coding agent implementing the service. The application shell and database persistence baseline now have local implementation and verification evidence. Native authentication handling, policy enforcement, SMTP delivery, and the rest of the first release remain planned. Nothing described as planned is implemented merely because it appears here.

Some planned feature contracts cite source-inspected Better Auth 1.7.8 behavior. Session 2 installed 1.7.12 for native schema generation; revalidate those runtime behaviors against 1.7.12 before implementing the corresponding feature.

The first release requires web and native mobile (iOS and Android) authentication with every feature in the repository README: email and username/password, Google OAuth, two-factor authentication, magic links, email OTP, passkeys, enterprise SSO, account management, session management, and SuperAdmin bootstrap. These are delivered through smaller milestones; the first milestone is not the complete release. Native desktop remains future work.

## Architecture

Use NestJS 11 with its Express adapter, `@thallesp/nestjs-better-auth` as the selected Nest integration layer, Better Auth with the supported PostgreSQL integration, and TypeORM for service-owned data. The integration library owns the single native handler and provides AuthModule/AuthService, session guards and decorators; compose service policy around those capabilities. Better Auth owns credentials, challenges, native sessions, federation, and authentication plugin tables. Nest owns application access, server-side MFA assurance, administrative orchestration, SMTP delivery, audit policy, and operational endpoints.

```

Use one shared identity realm and explicitly approved first-party applications. Each web application proxies authentication under its own origin and receives host-only cookies. Mobile apps authenticate through a hosted first-party portal in the system browser, then exchange a PKCE-bound one-time handoff through the public gateway for a signed opaque bearer session stored in Keychain/Keystore. The gateway holds the private backend credential; it is never embedded in the app. All methods and MFA use the same identity and policy authority. See the required [mobile authentication contract](14-mobile-authentication/README.md).

A shared user record does not grant access to every application. Enterprise SSO means accepting external OIDC and SAML identity providers; operating an OAuth/OIDC authorization server is deferred.

## Master roadmap

| Milestone | Dependencies and deliverables | Promotion gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 Architecture baseline | 00 and 01; inventory current source, choose pinned compatible packages | Package and route evidence recorded; no claim of runtime verification |
| M1 Foundations | M0; 02 through 05 plus initial application/BFF/mobile-gateway provisioning and ingress from 13 and 14; composition, schemas, security, audit, SMTP | Public-client/gateway and private-backend trust boundaries configured; configuration, schema grants, and mail failure behavior verified later |
| M2 Core identity | M1; 06 and 07 plus native signed bearer and one-time-token integration | Verified credential login, recovery, cookie/bearer session revocation, and native response preservation |
| M3 Administration and MFA | M2; 08 and 09 | Safe bootstrap, access boundaries, and all-method assurance enforcement |
| M4 Complete README authentication | M3; 10 through 12 and hosted mobile authentication portal | Every method, including password, OTP, magic links, Google, passkeys, OIDC, and SAML, works in the hosted system-browser flow and passes MFA policy |
| M5 Integration and launch | M4; application integration in 13, mobile authentication in 14, operations in 16, and evidence from 15 | Real iOS and Android handoff, secure storage, replay/PKCE rejection, renewal and revocation; web parity; restore drill, rotation, rollback, and limited rollout complete |

M2 and M3 are development milestones. They do not satisfy the user's complete first-release feature scope. Read and implement the minimal operator provisioning/ingress subsets of 13 and 14 during M1; their complete integration tasks remain M5. This avoids needing an already authenticated user to provision the first BFF or gateway. Mobile authentication is a separate task with the objective, dependencies, API/data contracts, implementation steps, and acceptance criteria in folder 14. Production security, monitoring, migration review, backup/restore, and MFA bypass coverage are mandatory launch gates.

Production enhancements after launch include distributed abuse storage, delivery workers deployed separately, richer detection, and tuned telemetry. Optional future capabilities include organizations, isolated tenant realms, native desktop authentication, SCIM, and an OAuth/OIDC provider. Web and native mobile authentication must not be deferred from the first-release contract.

## Locked decisions and working defaults

- The architecture reference is maintained in Markdown. The selected System Design template supplies the overview structure; its retained DOCX is unchanged.
- PostgreSQL schemas are `auth`, `identity`, and `audit`. Runtime processes cannot create schemas or tables.
- Authentication uses database-backed opaque sessions. Cookie caching and authentication secondary storage are disabled initially; Redis is not required for the first release.
- Web cookie sessions and mobile signed opaque bearer sessions share Better Auth's database-backed session authority; no parallel JWT/refresh-token pair is introduced. Native mobile is a public client. A server-held service key authenticates its gateway to the private backend.
- Every mobile method uses the first-party hosted portal in ASWebAuthenticationSession/Android Custom Tabs. After complete MFA assurance, transfer the native session using a hashed one-time token with a one-minute lifetime, a PKCE S256-bound gateway transaction, and verified HTTPS Universal Links/App Links; never place a raw session token in a URL. Detailed contracts live in 14.
- Email uses Nodemailer as an SMTP transport library only. No provider SDK, Nest mailer framework, hosted email API, or email framework is introduced.
- MFA-enabled users must present TOTP or a recovery code after every sign-in method. Neither Google/SSO authentication nor a passkey automatically substitutes for that enrolled factor.
- First-party production hosts are exact allowlisted hosts within one controlled parent domain for a shared WebAuthn RP. Example domains throughout these documents are placeholders, not deployment claims.
- No production workload, region, team owner, or regulatory retention obligation was supplied. Operational targets and retention periods are explicit engineering defaults to confirm before launch.
- The application shell has its earlier local verification evidence. Session 2 adds nine applied migrations, local PostgreSQL role and persistence probes, passing lint and build checks, compiled migration listing, and compiled startup smoke evidence. Exact Node 24.22.1 and container deployment remain unverified.

## How to implement a phase

Read its prerequisites and linked shared contracts. Implement only its stated application work in a later coding task. Follow the numbered implementation steps, collect acceptance evidence, update the milestone status, and preserve earlier invariants. Do not add a second credential store, challenge service, session issuer, or authorization server to compensate for a misunderstood plugin boundary.

Session 1 established the runtime and common application shell. Session 2 established the database persistence baseline; see its [operations and evidence](03-database-and-persistence/SESSION-2-OPERATIONS.md). Keep package stores outside the repository, including `.pnpm-store`. Later sessions add the native authentication handler, security policy, and SMTP delivery before core identity routes are exposed.
